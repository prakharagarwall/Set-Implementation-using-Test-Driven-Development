# Set-Implementation-using-Test-Driven-Development
JUnit  testing has been implemented along with the set to check various test cases. 
Set has been implmented using array for easy undersatnding, but if you want better efficiency and memory, you can also use Arraylist, Hashset etc. for implementation.
Insert, Remove, check ahs been implemented.
Since it is Test Driven Development, so first the test case is designed, then the code for the test case is implemented and then if the code works properly we refactor the code.
